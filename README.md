- JavaScript: The core functionality of the game is implemented using JavaScript. This includes manipulating the game board, generating random positions for the hero, enemies, and power-ups, handling user input for moving the hero, updating game state (lives, enemies defeated), moving enemies, handling hero attacks, and restarting the game.
